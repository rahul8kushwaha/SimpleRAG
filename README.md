This is a Simple RAG using:
- Langchain as a support library
- Ollama phi3 model for generation
- Sentence bert(all-MiniLM-L6-v2) for embedding generation for context
- Chroma for generating vector DB and search
Just provide the PATHS, i.e. list of PDFs for generating context and PATH, i.e., the location where the persistent vector DB must be stored
